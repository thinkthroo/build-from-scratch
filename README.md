# build-from-scratch

build-from-scratch provides documentation on how to build open-source software (OSS) in the JavaScript ecosystem from scratch.

## Build from scratch interactively

If you want to follow along these tutorials and save your progress, get the [free course](https://tthroo.com/build-from-scratch)

## Why free?

build-from-scratch aims to provide tutorial guides for open source software (OSS) in the JavaScript ecosystem, with an MIT license. This is to honor the original OSS authors and not intend to profit from their code and hard work.

## Roadmap

1. Build shadcn-ui/uii from scratch
2. Build clsx from scratch
